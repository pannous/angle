# Cast - Canonical AST
Canonical AST, the only Abstract Syntax Tree you need, with importers+exporters to all languages (planned)

Currently used by [English script](https://github.com/pannous/english-script), [Angle language](https://github.com/pannous/angle) and as a Ruby to python converter. See ast-export.rb and ast_import.py ! Todo: cleanup, improve, write connectors for jvm/java clr/csharp

AST Treenode specification: see XML/[XSD](https://github.com/pannous/cast/blob/master/cast.xsd), [cast.py](https://github.com/pannous/cast/blob/master/cast.py) and [cast.rb](https://github.com/pannous/cast/blob/master/cast.rb), inspired and mostly based on [pythons ast](https://docs.python.org/release/3.4.2/library/ast.html#abstract-grammar)!
